# ats_dev_build
custom build of dudas ATS

1) This project is heavily WIP and not working, dont bother trying. Its even missing some files.
2) Hypothetical goal is to make trains Milsim-scenario usable, which means:
* adding ZEN/Zeus support for controlling (AI) trains
* making MP more resilient (removing shadow copy system) and wagons ViV capable
* add light switching functionality to at least one train engine when switching directions
* potentially include manual track switches, although this is even less likely to get done
